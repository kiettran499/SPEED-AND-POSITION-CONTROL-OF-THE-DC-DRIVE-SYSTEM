## Description

- The goal of this project is to design the DC motor whose speed and the position of the motor movement can be controlled:
- The first task is separated into 2 cases to control the speed:
  - Open loop:
  - Closed loop:
- The second task is to control the position of the Rotorâ€™s movement, there're 2 cases:
  - Closed loop:
  - Two cascaded loops:


## Hardware
